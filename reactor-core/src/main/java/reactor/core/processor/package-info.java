/**
 * This package offers a suite of asynchronous {@link org.reactivestreams.Processor} with backpressure support.
 * Unlike {@link reactor.ReactorProcessor}, these components will be unique and bound to a given stream of data.
 * A {@link org.reactivestreams.Processor} will manage its own thread(s), one by {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscriber}.
 * The message-passing will be implementation dependant, e.g. using a {@link com.lmax.disruptor.RingBuffer}.
 * Usually, the boundary will be implemented with a queue-based event dispatching and the Reactive Stream contract will
 * offer control over the available backlog. Long.MAX demand will however switch off the contract and rely on the impl
 * coordination strategy to back-off, like the RingBuffer waiting strategy, to slow down the Processor publisher.
